### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Christian

I have been working in the energy field for almost a decade â€“ ranging from large utilities over policy advisory and research. Coming from an engineering background, I have a passion for innovative technologies and process improvements that help us to tackle climate change. Being also an agricultural economist, I have a strong interest in the LULUCF[*](#myfootnote1) aspects of the energy transition.

My preferred languages for building models are `R` and `Python`.
